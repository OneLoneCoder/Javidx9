	What is this?
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	This is the code I created as part of my
	"Code-It-Yourself! Role Playing Game" series on YouTube. This is
	NOT a game. The project will compile and demonstrate several
	systems developed as part of that series. My original intention
	was to develop a small yet complete RPG, alas real life got in
	the way. After several months, I've decided to just open the source
	"as is", so it will contain bugs, be confusing and all round not
	up to the usual "quality" I strive for.
